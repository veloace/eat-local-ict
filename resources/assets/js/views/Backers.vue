            <p class="has-text-white">EatLocalICT is built and maintained by a volunteer staff to promote local restaurants, cafes, and bars in Wichita and the surrounding area. Ads annoy us and we believe they detract from the usability of this website.</p>
            <p class="has-text-white">We cannot guarantee that our database is complete or up-to-date, so if you see something that is missing or incorrect, please <a href="mailto:suggestion@eatlocalict.com?subject=Suggestion%20for%20EatLocalICT">let us know</a>. As we work on this web app, we have plenty of <router-link :to="{name:'about'}">planned features</router-link>, some of which will help make our database more up to date and reliable.</p>
            <h2 class="title has-text-white">Shirts, stickers and mugs</h2>
            <p class="has-text-white">We have a store online at <a href="https://teespring.com/eat-local-ict#pid=76&cid=5845&sid=front" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Teespring</a> that features merchandise that you will love. Proceeds from sales help us pay for development costs, servers, and maintenance.</p>
            <p class="has-text-white">If you don't want any merch, you can buy us a coffee on  <a href="https://ko-fi.com/veloace" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ko-Fi</a>. Proceeds help us keep this site up and running and our developers fueled with local Wichita coffee and food.</p>
            <h2 class="title has-text-white">Sponsors</h2>
            <p class="has-text-white">We don't have any sponsors yet, but we are open to it. Please <a href="mailto:sponsorships@eatlocalict.com&subject=EatLocalICT%20Sponsorship%20Inquiry">contact us</a> if you're interested.</p>
